# Virtual Travel App

This is a simple Python-based virtual travel app using Flask, Mapbox API for maps, and the Wikipedia API to retrieve information about each place. Users can virtually visit any place and get information about the special features of that location without actually going there.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install flask
pip install requests
pip install mapbox
```

3. Replace the placeholder `your_mapbox_access_token` in the `app.py` file with your own Mapbox API access token. You can obtain one by signing up for a free account at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing `app.py`.

2. Run the following command to start the Flask server:

```
python app.py
```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the virtual travel app.

4. Enter a place name or address in the search bar and click the "Search" button.

5. The app will display a map of the location along with a brief description from Wikipedia.

## Customization

This is a basic outline of a virtual travel app. You can add more features and improve the user interface by editing the Python code and HTML templates.
